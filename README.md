# ðŸŽµ Music Genre Clustering Based on Audio Features

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project explores unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster music tracks based on their audio features. Traditional music genres (e.g., rock, jazz, hip-hop) are often assigned subjectively or via metadata, which can overlook the true acoustic patterns of songs. By analyzing and clustering audio features, this project aims to provide a more data-driven approach to genre discovery and recommendation systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Discover hidden patterns in musical audio data using clustering techniques.
- Improve understanding of musical structure based on features like rhythm, tempo, and frequency.
- Provide foundational insights for:
  - Music recommendation systems
  - Automated playlist generation
  - Genre classification and discovery

## ðŸ“Œ Use Case

This project can be applied to build smarter music platforms that suggest songs not just based on user tags or genres, but by the intrinsic qualities of music itselfâ€”enabling:
- Better personalized playlists
- Enhanced music discovery
- Automatic genre labelling

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- (Optional) Librosa or other audio processing libraries

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Music-genre-clustering-based-on-audio-features
.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the entire pipeline from data loading to clustering and visualization.
- Datasets: Audio features dataset (assumed to be loaded in the notebook)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
